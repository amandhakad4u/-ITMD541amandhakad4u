    <h4 id="p1" class="par">I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. With a strong academic background in Computer Science and Engineering from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya in India, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to excellence by maintaining a 3.66/4.0 CGPA in my current program and a 7.49/10.0 CGPA during my undergraduate studies.

        My education has equipped me with a diverse skill set that spans various programming languages, including JavaScript, R, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and PL/SQL. I am also well-versed in database systems like Oracle, MySQL, and MongoDB, along with proficiency in tools and technologies such as Tableau, PowerBI, MS Excel, VS Code, Git, and GitHub. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with libraries and frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and OpenCV, which have been essential in my coursework and projects.
        
        During my professional journey, I interned at both Pepcoding Education and HieCOR Software Technologies in India. At Pepcoding, I worked as a backend web developer, gaining expertise in technologies like React JS, Node JS, and JavaScript. I contributed to the design of an online data structure learning platform, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students. Similarly, my role at HieCOR Software Technologies involved developing web applications using Python, Node JS, JavaScript, and React JS. Notably, I created a web application capable of detecting bank statements from images, highlighting my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.</h4>
    
    <h4 class="par" >In addition to my academic and professional achievements, I have undertaken significant projects that showcase my technical prowess. I developed a comprehensive DBMS web application for cricket game analysis using Oracle, JSP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrated my proficiency in creating multi-layered enterprise applications for data-driven sports analysis. Another project, an E-Attendance System, employed Python and OpenCV for facial recognition, significantly enhancing attendance tracking and management. My "Invisible Cloak" camera filter project, utilizing OpenCV, Python, and Tkinter, demonstrated my ability to apply advanced image processing techniques and create real-time visual effects.
    
        Beyond academics and work experience, I have excelled in coding platforms, ranking 6th in my institute on GeeksforGeeks and achieving a 4* STAR rank on CodeChef. My commitment to community involvement is evident through my volunteer experiences, including tutoring high school students in physics concepts and serving as a board member for Hawkapella, where I contributed to the planning and execution of musical events and workshops.
        
        In summary, I am a highly skilled and driven individual with a passion for technology and a track record of academic excellence, hands-on experience, and a commitment to giving back to the community. My diverse skill set, coupled with my dedication to continuous learning, positions me as a valuable asset in the field of Information Technology and Management.</h4> -->
